    shortDescription: jEAP Messaging is a library to handle messaging using kafka with well-defined message types.
    longDescription: >
      jEAP Messaging is a Spring Kafka–based library that standardizes messaging between
      microservices using well-defined, strongly typed message formats. Message types are
      specified via Avro schemas and descriptors, ensuring schema consistency and
      interoperability across services. The library provides Avro serialization to Kafka
      records, pre-configured producer and consumer beans, and Java annotations to declare
      message type usage on topics. It integrates seamlessly with the jEAP error handling
      service to handle failed messages, guaranteeing no message is lost.
      Designed for both events and commands, jEAP Messaging enforces clear contracts,
      supports robust error recovery, and accelerates development of reliable,
      maintainable event-driven systems.
    features:
      - A structured definition of message types using Avro Schema and message type descriptors
      - Avro serialization of message types to kafka records
      - Pre-configured Spring Kafka beans for producers and consumers
      - Declaration of consumed/produced message types on topics using Java annotations
      - Idempotent receiver pattern using a simple Java annotation
      - Maven plugins for managing a Message Type Registry repository
      - Support both SASL-SCRAM and AWS IAM authentication for Kafka
      - Support for Confluent and AWS Glue Schema Registries
      - Error handling for messages that fail during processing (integration with a jeap-error-handling service)
